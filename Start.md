# Getting Started 
As an intern who took over the project, I found it would be useful for future interns to have a concentrated guide for a better understanding on how the system works, so I decided to write one.

## Code
It is critical to get to know the libraries being used and how they generally work before reading, adjusting or writing any code. The [AccelStepper](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/index.html) library is used in this project. I went over different alternatives to this library, and did not find any better ones. The AccelStepper is the easiest and most convenient library to use to control stepper motors with Arduino. The reason it was chosen over the default Arduino stepper motor library is because it supports multiple simultaneous stepper motors and also supports acceleration and deceleration.
